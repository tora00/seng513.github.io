			Tanks are specialized in enduring damage and generating enmity (aggro) so that enemies won't chase healers or DPS. They have self buffs to support in damage reduction and aggro generation. This role can be identified by the blue-colored class/job golden frame icon.

							Warrior - Overview<br>
							Boasting a tremendous HP pool and Abilities that lend themselves to high burst damage, Warriors are a force to be reckoned with. They are often chosen to be off-tanks in full-party content, though they are certainly capable of filling the role of Main Tank as well. As a trade-off for their generous HP pool and comparatively high damage potential, Warriors possess somewhat lackluster mitigation tools compared to their Dark Knight and Paladin brethren.

							Paladin - Overview<br>
							Wielding a veritable arsenal of enmity and mitigation tools, Paladins make excellent tanks. While having only moderate HP, they have access to a plethora of defensive and healing actions. They are also capable of taking damage intended for allies. Because this job focuses primarily upon mitigating incoming damage, its damage output is the lowest of the three Tank Jobs.

							Dark Knight - Overview<br>
							Dark Knights strive to occupy the proverbial middle ground between Warrior and Paladin, providing the player with a balanced offering of mitigation and damage-dealing tools. This job uses MP to perform actions, and is known for draining mana very quickly if not managed well. Dark Knights can greatly increase their next offensive/defense action by using a special ability called Dark Arts.
