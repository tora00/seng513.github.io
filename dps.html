		<p>
			DPS (Damage Dealers) include physical and magical damage. Both are aimed at dealing damage in a plethora of ways: precise single-target attacks, area bursts, damage-over-time, summon spells, magical area spells, etc. Some DPS jobs also have healing and tanking properties, but these are very occasional and are not the main focus on endgame content. This role can be identified by the red-colored class/job golden frame icon. DPS jobs are divided into Melee DPS, Physical Ranged DPS, and Magical Ranged DPS.
