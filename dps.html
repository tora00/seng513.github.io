		<p>
			DPS (Damage Dealers) include physical and magical damage. Both are aimed at dealing damage in a plethora of ways: precise single-target attacks, area bursts, damage-over-time, summon spells, magical area spells, etc. Some DPS jobs also have healing and tanking properties, but these are very occasional and are not the main focus on endgame content. This role can be identified by the red-colored class/job golden frame icon.

		Monk - Overview
		Monks are a very agile melee job. The monk aims at keeping up Greased Lightning buff, dealing impressive sustained single-target damage, as well as having access to great area damage on higher levels. One key point for monks is position: many of their attacks deal more damage at certain positions, and some actions can trigger certain effects depending on position.

		Ninja - Overview
		Ninja is a stealthy melee job. They have access to a variety of ninjutsu which can be cast every 20 seconds, and can deal with enmity with very particular actions. These actions include transferring their enmity to other player, and reducing threat generation from a party member.
