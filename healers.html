						Overview<br>
						White Mages bear the highest healing output in the game. Through the use of HP regeneration abilities, a full HP heal, and occasional DPS bursts, white mages are a very varied healing job. They can swap healing power with damage power to provide a more DPS-oriented gameplay, and are often seen as a very simple starting job.

						Overview<br>
						Scholars are a mixed healing job. Mastering this job is considered difficult because of all the micromanaging involving their own healing spells, and pet healing spells. Due to their access to aetherflow scholars don't see much problems with MP management like white mages for example, and they can also deal the highest continuous DPS from all healers with damage-over-time actions.

						Overview<br>
						Astrologians are a healing time-mage job. Their actions are based on both heal-over-time and MP regeneration, as well as using cards to cast offensive buffs and recover mana. Besides having damage increase buffs, astrologians deal the least damage out of all healers.
